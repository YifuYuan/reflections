The source I picked is a Sankey diagram showing the rank of electronics exporters from 2000 to 2021. I like how it clearly
presents the trending of the country's share of total across the years. The width of the bands in it is proportional to the
flow quantity they represent. This makes it easy to see at a glance where the largest flow is, which can be more intuitive
than trying to interpret the same information in a table or a different type of chart. It is clear that China's contribution
increased the most over the 11 years, while some other countries' share dropped out of the top 10. Expanding on such data, I thought
it would also be interesting to create a world map that presents where these countries exported to get a general picture of
the market. The designer also differentiates the increase and decrease using the color to make it clear and distinguishable. 
It is overall visually appealing and can convey a message with a strong visual impact. I think it could potentially be turned 
into an interactive plot so that the users can hover over flows to get more information, or to filter and see only parts of the flows they are interested in.
