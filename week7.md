This data visualization presents a heat map to illustrate the impact of vaccines on the incidence of measles over time across various states in the U.S.
For such visualization purposes, the heat map does a good job of tracking the case number across all the states through all these years. 
The heat map uses a color gradient that effectively shows the range of cases, with darker colors indicating higher numbers of cases. 
This helps to visually capture the decline in measles cases after the introduction of the vaccine.
I especially like the scale at the bottom, which provides a quantitative reference for interpreting the colors, adding precision to the visual analysis. 
What's more, the designer made the scale interactive so that the indicator move around along with the selected data point on the heatmap.
I think this is especially helpful when the scale is represented by the gradient colors, making it very straightforward for the readers to get the value comparison.
I also noticed that the heatmap is not even distributed, the orange and red took most part of the scale. 
I assume that is for highlighting differences at lower numbers better, or for visually pleasing purposes. 
Or the designer wants to focus on the decline of disease incidence after the introduction of vaccines. A non-linear scale might exaggerate the declines to make this 
effect more visually apparent.
