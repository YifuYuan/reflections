The visualization I picked for this week focuses on Wine and Math. I especially like how the designer explores the relationship between wine characteristics and their quality ratings through storytelling style and design. It uses interactive elements, charts, and narrative text to guide readers through the data, allowing for an engaging and educational experience. There are also some places where the user can play with the bar and interact during the scrolling. The transition of the drawings between different frames was smooth and intuitive, like an animation. It provides a fluid and engaging experience as users navigate through the information. It uses motion to draw attention to key aspects of the data, guide the viewer's journey, and illustrate changes or comparisons. The design style is also interesting, making the experience almost like reading a book. The choice of color is calm, not especially standing out. The only thing that I would like to refine is to add a menu bar on the side of the page so that the user can quickly navigate through different sections that they are interested in.
