The source I picked is an interactive map by data viz designer and researcher Justin Fung, which shows the mini-migrating during a
single day. The data is from the 2010 Census, the MTA's turnstile database, and a previous NYU study. He created block-by-block
estimates for Manhattan's population, which were reflected in the map's depiction of hourly changes throughout the week. The bars,
looking like skyscrapers, reveal the population of a specific block and dark red colors indicate a denser population in Midtown, 
the Financial District, and other areas. I like how the designer divided the Manhattan map into those blocks that are spread out. 
The interactive bar at the bottom also gives the viewer an idea of what's the migration flow of a day. Viewers can also rotate 
and view the map from different angles, and the process is surprisingly smooth. It also provided a statics panel where the viewer 
can check the statics in a more straightforward way. I can easily tell that, Midtown has the highest difference from the overnight
population, along with other statistics. Overall, the design is clean and smooth, and informative.
