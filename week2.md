The source I picked is a 3D population density map, visualizing the informative data in 3D perspective. I like how clean it looks and readers can understand the information it carries intuitively without any extra legends or explanations. The addition of one more dimension is very effective compared to traditional 2D graphs. It allows for an immediate visual interpretation of which areas are more densely populated through the height of the spikes. The blue color gradient provides a visually appealing and clear way to differentiate between areas of varying density. The potential problem is that this 3D population map makes it harder to make precise comparisons between areas compared to 2D maps. Additionally, without a legend or scale, it's difficult to quantify the population density from the spikes alone. It can only be used for demonstrating a general picture of how the population is distributed instead of serious analysis. To solve such an issue, the designer might try to make the map interactive, showing detailed data information when the mouse moves over to a certain area or spike. But to show the general idea, this 3D population density map is good enough with clear shapes and engaging colors.
