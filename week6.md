The picked data visualization compares the top ten nuclear explosions of all time. I like how the designer creates the visual hierarchy, where the use of the size of the
mushroom clouds conveys the relative magnitudes of the nuclear explosions in a direct way. Mount Everest at the top left corner also does a good job of providing viewers with
a familiar benchmark to grasp the scale of the explosions. The quarter circle at the background of each explosion adds up the information density of the graph without taking up
extra spaces. The use of color coding for the different aspects (such as the height of the explosion's mushroom cloud and the total measure of destructive radius) allows for 
quick visual cues. The key on the side is a good guide for understanding these colors and symbols. The annotations provide context, such as the note about the Bikini Atoll 
and the impact of nuclear testing on its environment. If there's anything I could potentially improve, I would probably first make the graph in the horizontal direction, so that the 
explosions will be displayed chronologically without being cut off in half. The sources are mentioned at the bottom, but they could be more explicitly tied to the specific data 
points for those who might want to learn more about each test. Also, the cue of viewing is not clear for this graph. For some viewers, the amount of visual information could be overwhelming.
